**The Humans are Dead, We are all Bots Now**

**With Tommy Lewis **

**The Case for Bots**

* 19-year-old created a robot lawyer which helped overturn 160,000 parking tickets. [(link)](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/06/29/19-year-olds-robot-lawyer-overturns-160000-parking-tickets/)

* Conversations as a Platform

    * 3 Things to consider

        * People - Remember that there are people who will be using this

        * Digital assistants (e.g. Siri, Cortana, Alexa) - Becoming increasingly ingrained in everyday life

        * Bots

    * Requires new ways of thinking:

        * Human language is the new UI

        * Bots are apps; digital assistants are meta apps

        * Intelligence is infused into all interactions

    * Conversational UI + Intelligence are the differentiators - this will set the good bots from the mediocre bots

* The Bot Hype

    * The furor against touchscreens

        * People used to think touchscreen wouldn’t fly. Turns out they did.

            * Why would I want to touch my screen? My arms will be tired!

            * What? 140 characters?

            * Who wants a phone with no apps?

            * Why would I take a picture of my lunch?

            * Why would I use emojis?

        * Bots are going through the same birthing pains right now

    * BOTTOM LINE: We’re going to have crappy bots. Deal with it. It’s part of the maturation process for bots.

**Why Now?**

* Messaging and social are the top experiences across all platforms

* All the large players have bought in

* Language understanding has progressed considerably

* Conversational UI is familiar

* AI and Machine Learning are mainstream

* Cognitive services are accessible

**How Should We Design Our Bots?**

* Here’s the thing: People think we SHOULD build the bot, not WHY we should build a bot.

* Always ask: What problem is it attempting to solve?

    * Failure to answer this is a very strong indicator that it will not fly

    * "If you’re building a bot, it should be a bot! Not a human!" - Tommy Lewis

    * "Don’t try to be an actual person. Try to be a bot!" - don’t market it as a person!

* Question # 2: How does the bot react in crisis?

    * The bot should be capable of escalating a human’s issue to an actual human (in times of crisis)

* Other key considerations:

    * Does it provide specific responses that lead?

    * Does it confirm actions?

    * Is it accessible and inclusive?

    * Does it allow human interruption?

    * Did you map out all the paths?

    * Design for humans, not yourself

**How Do We Build our Bots?**

* Wit.ai (Facebook Messenger), Api.ai (Google), Roll Your Own

* What worked for Microsoft: Bot Framework (this is on Github, "Microsoft/BotBuilder")

* Start with Bot Builder

* You can debug with Visual Studio Code, upload to Microsoft’s Bot Directory [(link)](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder)

**Where do We Go From Here?**

* We shouldn’t think of bots like "Her" (the movie).

* We’re increasingly layering in Cognitive Services APIs to bots.

We’re still in the early phase of bots. Bots mean a new interaction model.
