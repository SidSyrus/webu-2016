**The Evolution and Future of Content Publishing**

**With Haris Mahmood**

**The Beginning**

* Hypertext

    * "Ye Olde Web" courtesy of Tim Berners-Lee

    * Intended to share research among researchers more seamlessly

    * Evolved into a proper standard, HTML… and grew exponentially into the "web of content"

    * The Internet has enabled better collaboration among people

    * BUT: Consumer Requirements hampered such seamless collaboration/efficiency

* Content Management Systems:

    * Evolution happens in the web out of limitations and abilities/possibilities

        * We have content, that we need to manage into a system (hence a CMS)

            * Early examples: Rainman, Filenet, Enterprise-scale CMS (PHP-Nuke, etc.)

        * 2003: WordPress was born

            * Allowed unlimited customizations and 3rd party extensions

            * Launched the "CMS Explosion" (which produced Joomla, Drupal, MySpace)

    * A new focus developed - we needed something that’s simpler, intuitive, and easier to use

        * Enter Squarespace (and others) 

**Today-ish**

* Lots of CMS options, but also lots of concerns

    * Performance

        * Many CMS don’t have the best performance (e.g. WP is dependent on cache clearing)

        * Common tensions: Features vs Performance (i.e. dependence on tables and ‘gross’ HTML markup, i.e. unclean code)

        * Tim Preston-Warner: Produced Jekyll (to solve the problem of gross HTML - content must be in static HTML) - site generators

            * Significantly reduced site load time

    * Webhook

        * Open-source; allows you to do self-hosting

    * Site Leaf

        * Sits on top of Jekyll and integrates well with GitHub (e.g. hosting) - allows content changes via code, github or visual interface (you’re not tied to doing updates in a particular way)

* Growth of new frameworks and libraries

    * New issue: Dev flexibility, content required on multiple platforms

    * Content API

        * Gave only the data

        * Separated data and presentation, i.e. decoupled

        * Eg. Prismic, Contentful

    * WP REST API

        * 40% of the Web is built on WP

        * Will allow to put content in just one place

* APIs speed up publishing!

    * Keeps content consistent

    * Allows for parallel development

    * Huge, incredible potential

**Helpful Tips**

* Given a project, take a step back and look at all the CMS options available

* You don’t have a build a custom CMS right off the bat - focus on other things that matter more, e.g. performance, UX, etc.

* Look at the requirements and needs of that particular project

* Determine what’s most appropriate for your platform and project
