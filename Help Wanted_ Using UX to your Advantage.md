**Help Wanted: Using UX to your Advantage**
-----------------------------------------------------------
*With Mariah Hay*

**The Difference Between UX and UI**

Important: UX is not UI

* UX touches the service, product, and the interface - you can’t design these selectively for they are experienced collectively

* UX as a whole entails: 

    * Research (typically owned by the PdM and UX designer); visit people in their context, know how they’re acting and find patterns across them:

        * User Goals

        * Tasks (to be accomplished)

        * Needs (that have to be met)

        * Desires (best experience possible)

        * Pain-points (job-to-be-done)

        * Workarounds 

        * WHY DO ALL THESE? Empathy

    * Strategy

        * Identify needs

        * Re-imagine current capabilities

        * Direct future offerings

        * Techniques: Interview breakdowns, Personas (Pluralsight combines the classical persona details with an empathy map), User Needs Mapping (identifies & documents explicit user needs), journey mapping

    * Design

        * Useful (here you ask "is this thing really what the user needs?")

        * Usable - easy, frictionless, intuitive

        * Desirable - delight

**The History of UX as an Industry**

* Common thread: UX is UI

* Mariah Hay: UX as we know it resulted from an amalgam of so many disciplines

    * Industrial Designers

    * Animators

    * Graphic designers

    * Web dev

* 1990: Computers in the home

    * The 4 disciplines came together in "one glorious terrible object that will change everything" - the computer

* UX sits at the centre of Tech, Business, and Design

**The Maturity of UX in an Organization**

* Ask: What types of products does your UX team work on?

    * Common problems:

        * Departments are siloed, segmented.

        * There is a DIGITAL DIVIDE - web vs physical products

            * We can’t have this. We have to be stewards of the end-to-end experience
