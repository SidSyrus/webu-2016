**Need For Speed: Tips to Optimize Your Website**

**With Anne Thomas**

People don’t often think about site optimization, but it is crucial to keeping visitors on your site.

**Why All The Fuss?**

* People want information NOW/can’t wait (case in point: loader bars turn people off)

* There are business reasons for this!

    * It’s good for business - conversion/sell all the things!

    * Instantaneous response time (to add items to cart)

    * Bounce rates (high bounce rates are bad!)

    * Google likes fast sites

        * MYTH: People are more forgiving of desktop sites than those on mobile. In reality, desktop users are just as impatient as mobile users.

**Ground Rules**

* Do no harm to data plans

* Embrace the new and progressive (e.g. check your site with PHP tools)

* Listen to your townsfolk and your stats

* Always be optimizing

**Optimization Culprits**

* Huge, full-width images

    * Thing is, conversion is 98% higher with images

    * Tradeoffs needed!

    * PRO TIP: Set a performance budget with your client, e.g. Set expectations as to what can and can’t go on the site in the name of performance

    * Use SVGs and responsive images whenever possible

* Webfonts 

* Multiple server requests/large files (combine CSS files, don’t separate them)

* Third-party JS

* Uncached files (use CDNs to address this)

* Render-blocking JS/CSS

* Crummy webhosts

    * <200ms = ideal server response time

* Page reloads

    * Use AJAX whenever you can to simply target the asset that needs to reload/update (thereby doing away with reloading the ENTIRE site)

**Debugging**

* Responsive images (srcset and sizes attribute)

    * WP has implemented responsive images

* Lazy loading and dynamic content

* Minify CSS, HTML, and JS

* AJAX

**The Future**

* HTTP/2

* Client hints

* Service workers

* AMP pages

**Tools of the Trade**

* Speed Testing (webpagetest, google page speed, vary, GTMetrix, Chrome dev tools)

* Vocabulary:

    * Speed index

    * Time to first byte

    * Response time vs load time

    * Perception of loading

* Groups and resources

    * Webperf meetups

    * User testing

    * Lynda.com (free to Toronto Public Library users)

    * Velocity Conference
