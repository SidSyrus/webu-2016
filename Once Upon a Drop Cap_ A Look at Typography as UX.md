**Once Upon a Drop Cap: A Look at Typography as UX**
-----------------------------------------------------------
*With Jason Pamental*

"When words were the experience and letters were your voice"

**Typography and UX**

* Typography has to do two things in order to be successful - communicate an idea and influence behaviour (this is the thing that separates art from design)

* How people perceive type influences the user’s experience. It’s the bridge between the viewer and the viewed.

* It’s the material, method and typefaces that forms the foundation of the user experience and the relationship among these elements that’s changing.

* Some examples:

    * The Ten Commandments - the type and where it is carved (in stone) communicates the importance and weight of the content

    * The Hobbit cover - There is an experience that is imparted with the way this (book) was physically made (e.g. texture, paper type, cover material, etc.)

    * The Underground font - this font face communicates that you *are* in the subway system

    * The Times paper - stable serifs and bold contrasts communicate and reinforce authority and force

**From Then to Now**

* Today: Millions and millions of Arial.

    * Result: A loss of (perceived) authority on web and mobile interfaces

    * Example: Small type for time (in-car interface)

        * Jason Pamental: "Tell me, what time is it… CRASH! BOOM! … By the time you find it, you’ve already hit the bus"

        * POINT: The lack of visual emphasis for something as vital as time (on car interfaces) makes unnoticeable and unfindable. "By the time you find it, you’ve already hit the bus"

* A change in how we practice typography is happening

    * We’ve moved from rendered (experiences) to dynamic - this introduces constraints to the presentation of content (and hence, perception/experience)

**A Way Forward**

* Web-safe fonts give you very limited control

* WOFF - includes OpenType features, 92% support

* WOFF2 - delivers 25% file size reduction, 64% supported

**The New Typography**

* Designing systems that can adapt to changing contexts and environments and devices

* Responsive typography

* It’s really important that we think through these things. But we’re really constrained.

    * We need to reconcile web performance and the language of design

    * Our desire to create more typographic expression gets really constrained by flaky internet connections/networks

* With limited fonts, our vocal range is curtailed

    * Type is the voice of our words

* BIGGEST CLAIM: **Variable fonts** may be the biggest leap forward in web design since Responsive Web Design itself
